# Recurse ML Documentation

> Recurse ML is an AI-powered static analysis tool that catches bugs your tests miss. This documentation site provides comprehensive guides, examples, and references for using Recurse ML to detect breaking changes, prevent API misuse, and enforce custom coding rules through GitHub integration or CLI usage.

Recurse ML offers two main ways to integrate static analysis into your development workflow: as a GitHub App for automated pull request reviews, or as a command-line tool for local development and CI/CD pipelines. The tool is designed to catch issues that traditional testing methods often miss, helping developers maintain code quality and prevent bugs from reaching production.
