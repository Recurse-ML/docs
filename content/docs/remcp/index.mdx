# Quick Install

**One-line install (macOS and Linux)**
```
curl -L remcp.recurse.ml | bash
```

📝 Next steps:
1. Make sure `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`. Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`: 

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

2. Authenticate with GitHub: 

```
remcp auth
```

3. Choose your IDE and follow the installation instructions:

- [Install in Claude Code](./installation/install-claude-code)
- [Install in Cursor](./installation/install-cursor)

# Usage tips

### Recurse prompt (recommended)

```
# In claude code
$ /recurse:review_code Please implement access control on web api endpoints
```
The prompt is automatically available once you install remcp, and claude will start using Recurse MCP for analyzing code changes.
