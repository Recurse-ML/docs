# Quick Install

**One-line install (macOS and Linux)**
```
curl -sSL https://storage.googleapis.com/remcp/install.sh | bash
```
📝 Next steps:
1. Make sure `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`. Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`: 

```export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"```

2. Authenticate with GitHub: 

```remcp auth```

3. Add to Claude Code: 

```claude mcp add recurse --scope user -- remcp serve```


# Usage tips:

## Configure claude code (recommended)

```bash
remcp configure claude
```
This installs a SessionStart hook that automatically reminds Claude to use remcp. This is a global configuration for claude.


If you are not happy with the global setting, you can remove it using the following
```bash
remcp configure claude --remove
```

## Recurse prompt

```
$ /recurse:review_code Please implement access control on web api endpoints
```
The prompt is automatically available once you install remcp, and claude will start using Recurse MCP for code changes.


## Project level configuration (manual)


To help your AI agent automatically use remcp, add instructions to your agent's rules file:

| MCP Client | Rules File Location |
|------------|---------------------|
| Claude Desktop/Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| VSCode Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules` |

**Add this line to your rules file:**

```
Use Recurse MCP for code analysis: call init() before starting, sync() after changes, then check() for results.
```
