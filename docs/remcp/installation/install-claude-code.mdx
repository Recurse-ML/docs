# Install in Claude Code

## Step 1: Add MCP to claude


```
claude mcp add recurse --scope user -- remcp serve
```

## Step 2: Configure CLAUDE.md


```bash
remcp configure claude
```

This installs a global rule in your CLAUDE.md file that ensures Claude Code uses remcp automatically.

## Removing the Configuration

If you want to remove the global rule and prefer to call remcp directly, you can run the following command:

```bash
remcp configure --remove claude
```
