## Prerequisites

- A recent version of a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)

- Git must be installed and available in your `PATH`
- `curl` must also be installed

## Installation

To install RML, open your terminal and run the following command:

```

This script will download and install the latest version of RML onto your system.

Once installed, you can verify that RML is available by running:

```bash

```

If the command returns `üêû Running rml version {version}`, RML has been installed successfully and is ready to use.
