## Coming Soon

Unfortunately, RML is not yet supported on Windows. A potential workaround is to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run RML in a Linux environment, but this is not officially supported.

If you would like to get in touch with the RML team to discuss Windows support, please reach out via the [Help and Support](../help-and-support.md) section.
