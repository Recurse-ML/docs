Get up and running with RML in just a few steps. This guide will show you how to install RML and run your first analysis as quickly as possible.

## 1. Install RML

RML can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows, or used via Docker. Choose the method that works best for your environment:

- [Installing on Linux](../getting-started/installing-on-linux)
- [Installing on macOS](../getting-started/installing-on-macos)
- [Installing on Windows](../getting-started/installing-on-windows)
- [Installing with Docker](../getting-started/installing-with-docker)

For the sake of this quickstart, we will use macOS as an example. If you are using a different operating system, please refer to the appropriate installation guide.

Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
curl install.recurse.ml | sh
```

## 2. Navigate to Your Git Repository

RML only works inside of Git repositories. To begin, navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

Make sure your project is initialized as a Git repository. If it is not, run:


```bash
git init
```

## 3. Run RML

Once inside the repository, you can run RML against a file you've recently modified:

```bash
rml path/to/your/file.js
```

RML will analyze unstaged changes in the specified file and report any bugs it detects.

ðŸŽ‰ That's it! You're now ready to start using RML to catch bugs early in your development process.
