title: Rules
---

The `rules` section of the `.recurseml.yaml` config file allows you to define additional checks that Recurse ML will perform.
They are best used for explicitly expressing and automatically enforcing project-specific conventions.
They can range from style suggestions, such as variable naming patterns, to sensitive directories that need additional verification (e.g. payments).

Rules are verified against modified code and reported in PR (for [GitHub App](/gh/)) or in CLI output (for [`rml`](/rml/)).

## Purpose

Rules let you:

- Explicitly specify codebase conventions
- Highlight files/directories that need additional analysis
- ⚡️**Pro tip:** use rules for effective onboarding.
  New team members can learn about codebase conventions through Recurse ML's comments.
  Add links to relevant blog posts inside of rule definitions.
  They appear [JIT](https://www.netlingo.com/word/just-in-time-jit.php) when they are relevant.

## Location and Discovery

The `.recurseml.yaml` file:

- Must be named `.recurseml.yaml`
- Can be placed anywhere in your repository
- Is located by a recursive search from the project root
- Only the **first** config file found is used

## Configuration

The `rules` field can be configured in two ways:

### Single Directory
```yaml
rules: .cursor/rules
```

### Multiple Directories
```yaml
rules:
  - .rules/clean_code/
  - .project_rules/
```

Recurse ML reads all `.md` and `.mdc` files from the specified directories.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field         | Type           | Required | Description                                     |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`        | string         | No       | Rule name (defaults to filename if not provided) |
| `Description` | string         | No       | Human-readable explanation of the rule           |
| `Globs`       | string or list | No       | File patterns to match (applies to all files if not specified) |

## Examples

### Single Directory Configuration
```yaml
rules: .cursor/rules
```

### Multiple Directories Configuration
```yaml
rules:
  - .rules/clean_code/
  - .project_rules/
```

### Example Rule File
```md
---
Name: require-docstrings
Description: All Python functions must have docstrings
Globs: "*.py"
---

# Python Docstring Requirements

All Python functions must include comprehensive docstrings that describe:
- Function purpose
- Parameters and their types
- Return values
- Any exceptions that may be raised
```

### Example Rule with Multiple File Patterns
```md
---
Name: no-todo-comments
Description: Disallow TODO comments in production code
Globs: 
  - "*.js"
  - "*.ts"
  - "*.{py,java}"
---

# No TODO Comments

TODO comments are not allowed in production code. Use proper issue tracking instead.
```

## Supported Glob Patterns

The `Globs` field supports Unix shell-style wildcards and brace expansion:

- `"*.py"` — All Python files
- `"src/*.js"` — JS files in the `src` directory
- `"src/**/utils/*.ts"` — Deeply nested TS utility files
- `"*.{py,ts}"` — Python and TypeScript files using brace expansion
- `"*.env"` — Hidden environment files

## Default Behavior

If no rules are provided, Recurse ML will perform its default analysis without any project-specific rules.
