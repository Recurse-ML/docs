spx enables you to define, run, and modify complex backend systems using only markdown specifications.

:::warning Early Preview
spx is still rough around the edges.
We'd love your feedback on how the spx development workflow compares to yours.

## Prerequisites

Before using spx, ensure you have:

- Claude Code CLI installed and available as `claude`.
- Runtime for your chosen implementation language (Python, TypeScript, or Rust).
    spx uses these languages as intermediary representations (IRs) to generate your actual implementation code.

## Quickstart

### 1. Download the spx Binary

Download the appropriate binary for your system architecture:

- **Linux x64:** [linux-x64](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-recurse-ml/spx/spx-linux-x64/spx)
- **Linux ARM64:** [linux-arm64](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-recurse-ml/spx/spx-linux-arm64/spx)
- **Linux x64 (musl):** [linux-x64-musl](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-recurse-ml/spx/spx-linux-x64-musl/spx)
- **Linux ARM64 (musl):** [linux-arm64-musl](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-recurse-ml/spx/spx-linux-arm64-musl/spx)
- **macOS Intel (x64):** [darwin-x64](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-recurse-ml/spx/spx-darwin-x64/spx)
- **macOS Apple Silicon (ARM64):** [darwin-arm64](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-recurse-ml/spx/spx-darwin-arm64/spx)
- **Windows x64:** [windows-x64](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-recurse-ml/spx/spx-windows-x64/spx.exe)

**Troubleshooting:**
1. If using MacOS Rosetta, download the binary for `darwin-arm64`.


**Adding to your PATH:**

After downloading, make the binary executable and add it to your PATH:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x spx
sudo mv spx /usr/local/bin/

# Or add to your user bin directory (no sudo required)
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv spx ~/.local/bin/
# Add to your shell config: export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator)
# Move spx.exe to a directory like C:\Program Files\spx\
# Add that directory to your PATH environment variable
```

Verify installation:
```bash
spx --version
```

### 2. Create a New Project

Navigate to where you want your project and create a new directory:
```bash
mkdir my-spx-project
cd my-spx-project
spx init
```

This initializes a new spx project with the following structure:
```
my-spx-project/
├── specs/              # Your markdown specifications go here
│   └── example.md      # Starter example spec
├── .spx/               # Internal spx metadata (don't edit)
│   └── prev_specs/     # Tracks changes between generations
├── out/                # Generated code appears here (auto-created on first gen)
├── project.spx.toml    # Project configuration file
└── .gitignore          # Pre-configured to ignore generated files
```

The `spx init` command will interactively prompt you for:
- Project name
- Location of the `claude` binary (defaults to `~/.local/bin/claude`)

This information is saved in `project.spx.toml`:
```toml
[project]
name = "microservice-footgun"
version = "0.1.0"

[spx]
claude_code_bin = "~/.local/bin/claude"
```

**What each directory does:**

- **`specs/`** - Where you write your system specifications in markdown. All `.md` files here are read by spx.
- **`.spx/`** - Internal tracking data used by spx to detect changes and optimize generation.
- **`out/`** - Contains generated implementation code. You can read this to understand what was generated, but don't edit it directly - changes will be overwritten.

### 3. Build!

#### Define Specs

Create or edit markdown files in `specs/`.
spx reads all `.md` files in the `specs/` directory and treats them as the specification for your system.

Principles for writing effective specs:

1. **Be specific about end-user behavior:** clearly define the interfaces (whether CLI or API endpoints) that are exposed to your users.
2. **Managing granularity:**
    you're in control of the level of granularity at which you want to work at.
    For example, if the database engine and schema is important to your design, you should specify them.
    But if they're not, then LLM will likely make a reasonable guess.
3. **Out of scope:** explicitly state what's out of scope for now and the limitations you're fine with at the current stage.


#### `spx build`

Once your spec is ready, build your system:
```bash
spx build
```

This command:
- Reads all markdown files from `specs/`
- Compares them with the previous generation (if any)
- Uses Claude Code CLI to generate or update code in `out/`
- Creates/updates `out/build.sh` and `out/run.sh` scripts
- Runs `out/build.sh` to build the generated code
- Sets up language-specific environments (virtualenv for Python, npm install for TypeScript, etc.)
- Installs required libraries
- Compiles code if necessary (e.g., for Rust or TypeScript)

**First time:** Generates everything from scratch and builds it.

**Subsequent runs:** Only updates what changed in your specs, preserving what still matches, then rebuilds

#### `spx run`

Executes your generated system.
Any arguments you pass to `spx run` are forwarded to your application's entry point.

#### Iterate

As you develop, update your specs in `specs/` and repeat the cycle.
spx tracks what changed and only updates relevant parts of your implementation.

## How It Works

spx is a programming language that uses traditional languages (Python, TypeScript, Rust) as intermediary representations.
You control your system architecture and behavior through specs, not by writing implementation code directly.

## Commands Reference

- `spx init` - Initialize a new spx project
- `spx build` - Generate/update implementation code from specs and build it
- `spx run [args]` - Execute your system (forwards args to your application)
- `spx clean` - Remove all generated code and build artifacts

## Best Use Cases

spx works best for:

- **Web backends and APIs** - REST/GraphQL servers, microservices
- **CLI tools and scripts** - Command-line utilities, automation scripts  
- **ML pipelines** - Training scripts, data processing, inference servers

spx is designed for non-visual backend systems. For applications with significant UI components, traditional development approaches may be more suitable.
